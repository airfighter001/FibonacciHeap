# FibonacciHeap
Basic C implementation of a Fibonacci Heap for a uni project.
Even though it works for the purposes of the project, I advise against using it for anything else. It is very untested and probably not fully working.
Additionally, full functions in a header file the way I did it is not recommended to put it lightly. It works for my use case so it might stay this way, but you absolutely shouldn't do it.
